### COMPONENTS OF NETWORK
- servers
- clients
- transmission media


### DATAFLOW TYPE
- simplex
- half duplex
- full duplex


### TOPOLOGY 
learn advantages and disadvantages last
- star topology
- ring topology
- bus topology
- completely connected network 
- mesh network
- tree network

### TYPES OF NETWORK
- PAN
- LAN
- CAN campus area network
- MAN - metropolitan area network
- WAN - wide area network
- GAN - global area network


### NETWORK MODELS
- protocol models
	- has exact details about implementation TCP/IP
- reference models
	- does not have exact details about implementation just a reference OSI model


### LAYERED ARCHITECTURE

- services
	- each layer provides service to the ones above it aiding in communication
- protocol
- interfaces
	- it is the way in which data or messages are transferred between layerrs


### OSI MODEL OPEN SYSTEM INTERCONNECTION

1. physical
2. data link
	- used to ensure that there is an error free path between the sender and the reciever there are two
	- llc logical link control
	- media access control
	- jobs
	- flow control
	- error control
	- access control
	- synchronisation
-  network
	- fragmentation
	- reassembly
	- routing
-  transport
	1. error control
	2. flow control
	3. port addressing
	4. congestion control
-  session
	1. session estabilishment
	2. maintain
	3. terminate
	4. authentication
	5. permission
	6. sycnhronisation
-  presentation
	1. encryption
	2. decryption
	3. marshalling
	4. unmarshalling
	5. compression
-  application


### TCP IP NETWORK MODEL

- link layer or network access layer
	- 
- internet layer
	- responsible for sending packets through different networks
	- host addressing and identification
	- packet routing
	- ARP ip to ethernet
	- ICMP internet control message protocol used for diagnostis and error like ping
	- RARP reverse address resolution protocol
	- IGMP internet group messaging protocol - support mutlicasting 
- transport layer
	- tcp
	- udp
- application layer


### DCE (data circuit terminating equipment)  / DTE (data terminal equipment)

A DCE is anything that has the ability to send or recieve analogue or digital data over a network the example is a modem a dce is between dte and data transmission circuit


a dte is the source of raw data the dte will ingest the data then encode it modulate enable it in a form to be transported and then it is introduced onto the telecommunication link or data transmission circuit 


### EIA RS 232 DTE/DCE INTERFACE 
just explain what u already know

### CCITT X.21 INTERFACE
The CCITT X.21 interface is a standard for connecting devices, like computers and routers, so they can share data over a leased line, which is a dedicated connection between two points. It uses a special type of cable with a 15-pin connector or sometimes an RJ-45 connector. The X.21 interface makes sure that data can be sent and received reliably by defining how devices communicate with each other. It's like having a set of rules that everyone follows to ensure smooth communication. This interface was essential for early computer networks and telecommunications systems before newer technologies like Ethernet became widespread.



### NETWORK SWITCHING
- circuit switching
	- circuit estabilishment
	- data transfer
	- circuit disconnect
- packet switching
	- virtual circuit approach
		- cross between packet and circuit switching you know what that is 
	- datagram approach
		- no specific path independent
- message switching
	-
